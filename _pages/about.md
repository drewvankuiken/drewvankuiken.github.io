My name is Drew Van Kuiken. I'm a second-year Econ Ph.D. student at [UNC - Chapel Hill](https://econ.unc.edu/graduate/). I'm interested in industrial organization (with a focus on innovation and market power), corporate finance, and organization economics. Methodologically, I've enjoyed reading and building structural models. 

Outside of econ, I enjoy backcountry skiing, hiking, and Eu4 (a history simulator game that is surprisingly cool).

You can find my CV [here](/files/2023.12.24_vita.pdf).
