I'm a fourth-year Econ Ph.D. student at [UNC - Chapel Hill](https://econ.unc.edu/graduate/). I'm interested in industrial organization, with a focus on innovation and market power. Methodologically, I've enjoyed reading and building structural models. 

Outside of econ, I enjoy backcountry skiing, hiking, and, courtesy of my parents, Detroit-area sports teams.
