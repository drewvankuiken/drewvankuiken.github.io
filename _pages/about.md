I'm a fourth-year Econ Ph.D. student at [UNC - Chapel Hill](https://econ.unc.edu/graduate/). I'm interested in industrial organization, with a focus on innovation and market power. Methodologically, I've enjoyed reading and building structural models. 

Outside of econ, I enjoy backcountry skiing, funky music, and, courtesy of my parents, Detroit-area sports teams.

You can find my CV [here](/files/2024.09.13_vita.pdf). My email is [drew.van.kuiken@unc.edu](mailto:drew.van.kuiken@unc.edu).

**New Stuff**
- I'll be at the Southern Economic Association conference in Washington D.C. from November 23-25, 2024 (presenting on Sunday)
