My name is Drew Van Kuiken. I'm a second-year Econ Ph.D. student at UNC - Chapel Hill. I'm interested in industrial organization (with a focus on innovation and market power), corporate finance, and organization economics. Methodologically, I've enjoyed reading and building structural models. 

Outside of econ, I love (backcountry) skiing, hiking, and Eu4 (a history simulator game that is surprisingly cool).
