### Works in Progress
- "What Can Web Traffic Reveal About Demand for Air Travel?" (with [Alex Marsh](https://alexmarsh.io/), [Garrett Scott](https://sites.google.com/view/garrettscott/home), and [Jon Williams](https://jonwms.web.unc.edu/))
    - Using data from a major North American airline's website and Google Flights, we analyze consumer search and purchase behavior across different markets and competitive settings. We find clear differences in search and purchase behavior based on consumer characteristics (e.g., loyalty-program members buy closer to departure dates), flight characteristics (weekend departure dates are most expensive), and markets (as the airline's price rises relative to its competition's, conversion rates decrease). 
- "Product Quality and Consolidation" (with [Nate Miller](http://www.nathanhmiller.org/), [Nick Rupp](https://myweb.ecu.edu/ruppn/), and [Jon Williams](https://jonwms.web.unc.edu/))
